## 2. PRIMITIVE VARIABLES TYPES
In Java, variables are used to store and manipulate data. There are several types of variables, each with its own characteristics and uses. 

| Definition | Example | Size | Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| char | 'b', 'B', '9', '&' | 1 byte | -2^7...2^7-1 (-128...127) |
| int | -5, 9, 8214 | 4 bytes | -2^31...2^31-1 |
| long | -3, 77, 8234 | 8 bytes | -2^63...2^63-1 |
| short | -1, 3, 1456 | 2 bytes | -2^15...2^15-1 |
| byte | -2, 8, 42 | 1 byte | -2^7...2^7-1 |
| double | 5.22, -89, 1.65 | 8 bytes | -1.7*10^308 to 1.7*10^308 |
| float | 44.22, -89, 8.6 | 4 bytes | -3.4*10^38 to 3.4*10^38 |
| boolean | true / false | 1 byte | true / false |

### 2.1 Example 
```java
  public class ExamplesOfBasicVariablesTypes
  {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
		  // define char
      char c = 'k';
      // define int 
      int num = 5;
      // define long
      long num1 = 765;
      // define sort
      sort num2 = 6;
      // define byte
      byte num3 = 32;
      // define double
      double num4 = 326;
      // define float
      float num5 = 89;
      // define boolean
      boolean bool = true;
	 }// end of method main 
  }// end of class ExamplesOfBasicVariablesTypes
```

## 3. TAKING INPUT

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ZBEMh8FGeNANCeBaEd/giphy.gif">

in this table we use: 
Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in) <br>
In Java, there are several ways to take input from a user. 

**Here the Scanner method**:

(Remember to use the Scanner class you need to import it using import java.util.Scanner;
It should be used at the very beginning of your java file before any other code written.
So, you can use the methods in the table below after importing the class.)

| Data Type | Format |
| --- | --- |
| int | in.nextInt() |
| short | in.nextShort() |
| long | in.nextLong() |
| char | in.next().charAt(0) |
| float | in.nextFloat() |
| double | in.nextDouble() |
| byte | in.nextByte() |
| boolean | in.nextBoolean() |
| String | in.next() |
| A string across an entire line including spaces | in.nextLine() |

### 3.1 Example 
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class InputExample 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        // make a Scanner object
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Prompt user to enter an integer
        System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
        int num1 = scan.nextInt();

        // Prompt user to enter a short
        System.out.print("Enter a short: ");
        short num2 = scan.nextShort();

        // Prompt user to enter a long
        System.out.print("Enter a long: ");
        long num3 = scan.nextLong();

        // Prompt user to enter a character
        System.out.print("Enter a character: ");
        char ch = scan.next().charAt(0);

        // Prompt user to enter a float
        System.out.print("Enter a float: ");
        float num4 = scan.nextFloat();

        // Prompt user to enter a double
        System.out.print("Enter a double: ");
        double num5 = scan.nextDouble();

        // Prompt user to enter a byte
        System.out.print("Enter a byte: ");
        byte num6 = scan.nextByte();

        // Prompt user to enter a boolean
        System.out.print("Enter a boolean: ");
        boolean bool = scan.nextBoolean();

        System.out.println("You entered: " + num1 + ", " + num2 + ", " + num3 + ", " + ch + ", " + num4 + ", " + num5 + ", " + num6 + ", " + bool);
    }// end of method main
}// end of class InputExample
```

## 4. ARITHMETIC
In Java, arithmetic operations are used to perform mathematical calculations on variables.

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5UCpmbzvZKQCfuF2P2/giphy.gif">

| Operations | Symbol |
| --- | --- |
| Addition | + |
| Subtraction | - |
| Multiplication | * |
| Division | / |
| Modulus | % |

### 4.1 Example 

```java
public class Arithmetic
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int a = 5;
        int b = 2;

        // addition
        int c = a + b;
        System.out.println("Addition: " + a + " + " + b + " = " + c);

        // subtraction
        c = a - b;
        System.out.println("Subtraction: " + a + " - " + b + " = " + c);

        // multiplication
        c = a * b;
        System.out.println("Multiplication: " + a + " * " + b + " = " + c);

        // division
        c = a / b;
        System.out.println("Division: " + a + " / " + b + " = " + c);

        // modulus
        c = a % b;
        System.out.println("Modulus: " + a + " % " + b + " = " + c);
    }// end of method main
    
}// end of class Arithmetic
```
### 4.2 Shorthand Experssions 

| Shorthand Expressions | Symbol |
| --- | --- |
| Addition Assignment | += |
| Subtraction Assignment | -= |
| Multiplication Assignment | *= |
| Division Assignment | /= |
| Modulus Assignment | %= |

### 4.3 Shorthand Experssions Example
```java
public class ShorthandExpressions 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        int x = 10;
        int y = 5;

        // addition assignment
        x += y;
        System.out.println("Addition Assignment: x += y : " + x);

        // subtraction assignment
        x -= y;
        System.out.println("Subtraction Assignment: x -= y : " + x);

        // multiplication assignment
        x *= y;
        System.out.println("Multiplication Assignment: x *= y : " + x);

        // division assignment
        x /= y;
        System.out.println("Division Assignment: x /= y : " + x);

        // modulus assignment
        x %= y;
        System.out.println("Modulus Assignment: x %= y : " + x);
    }// end of method main 
}// end of class ShorthandExpressions 
```
## 5. CASTING
In Java, casting is the process of converting one data type to another.

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/C9iYoljYrwIISmWBWg/giphy.gif">

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Implicit casting | Also known as automatic casting, it occurs when a smaller type is converted to a larger type without the need for explicit casting. |
| Explicit casting | Also known as manual casting, it occurs when a larger type is converted to a smaller type. |

### 5.1 Example

```java
public class Casting 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        // Implicit casting
        int a = 10;
        long b = a; // automatic casting from int to long

        // Explicit casting
        double c = 2.12;
        int d = (int)c; // explicit casting from double to int

        System.out.println("Implicit casting: int to long : " + b);
        System.out.println("Explicit casting: double to int : " + d);
    }// end of method main 
}// end of class Casting
```

## 6. RELATIONAL AND LOGICAL EXPRESSIONS

In Java, relational and logical expressions are used to make comparisons and control the flow of a program.

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2aWxyHllMdWS07RCnU/giphy.gif">

| Logical And Relational Expressions | Symbol | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AND | && | Returns true if both operands are true |
| OR | \|\| | Returns true if one or both operands are true |
| NOT | ! | Returns true if the operand is false and false if the operand is true |
| Less than | < | Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand |
| Less than or equal to | <= | Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand |
| Greater than | > | Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand |
| Greater than or equal to | >= | Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand |
| Not equal to | != | Returns true if the operands are not equal |
| Equal to | == | Returns true if the operands are equal |

### 6.1 Example 

```java
public class RelationalAndLogicalExpressions
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int a = 13;
        int b = 5;

        // relational greater than
        if (a > b)
        {
            System.out.println("a is greater than b");
        }

        // relational less than
        if (a < b)
        {
            System.out.println("a is less than b");
        }

        // relational greater than or equal to
        if (a >= b)
        {
            System.out.println("a is greater than or equal to b");
        }

        // relational less than or equal to
        if (a <= b)
        {
            System.out.println("a is less than or equal to b");
        }

        // relational equal to
        if (a == b)
        {
            System.out.println("a is equal to b");
        }

        // relational not equal to
        if (a != b)
        {
            System.out.println("a is not equal to b");
        }

        // logical AND
        if (a > b && a < 20)
        {
            System.out.println("a is greater than b and less than 20");
        }

        // logical OR
        if (a > b || a < 20)
        {
            System.out.println("a is either greater than b or less than 20");
        }

        // logical NOT
        if (!(a == b))
        {
            System.out.println("a is not equal to b");
        }
    }// end of method main
}// end of class RelationalAndLogicalExpressions
```

## 7. CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
In Java, conditional statements are used to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. The most basic and commonly used conditional statement is the if statement.

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/mDN2PrgD9VuQJG0LY2/giphy-downsized.gif">

### 7.1 If Statement

The if statement allows you to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is true. The basic syntax for an if statement is as follows:

| Syntax | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `if (condition) ` <br> ` {` <br> `// code to be executed if the condition is true` <br> `}` | Executes a block of code if the specified condition is true |
| `if (condition) ` <br> ` {` <br> `// code to be executed if the condition is true` <br> `} ` <br> ` else ` <br> ` {` <br> `// code to be executed if the condition is false` <br> `}` | Executes a block of code if the specified condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false |
| `if (condition1) ` <br> ` {` <br> `// code to be executed if condition1 is true` <br> `} ` <br> ` else if ` <br> ` (condition2) {` <br> `// code to be executed if condition2 is true` <br> `} ` <br> ` else ` <br> ` {` <br> `// code to be executed if both conditions are false` <br> `}` | Executes a block of code for the first true condition, and another block of code if none of the conditions are true |

### 7.2 Example 

```java
public class IfElseExample
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {

        int age = 40;

        // if statement
        if (age >= 18)
        {
            System.out.println("You are an adult.");
        }

        // if-else statement
        if (age >= 21)
        {
            System.out.println("You can drink alcohol.");
        } 
        else
        {
            System.out.println("You cannot drink alcohol.");
        }

        // if-if-else-else statement
        if (age >= 65)
        {
            System.out.println("You are a senior citizen.");
        } 
        else if (age >= 18)
        {
            System.out.println("You are an adult.");
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("You are a minor.");
        }
    }// end of method main 
}// end of class IfElseExample
```

### 7.3 Switch Statement

A switch statement in Java is used to execute different code based on the value of an expression. The expression is evaluated, and the corresponding branch of the switch statement is executed. 

### 7.4 Example

```java
public class WeekDayChecker 
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int day = 2;
        // switch statement to check the day of the week
        switch(day)
	{
            case 1:
                System.out.println("Monday");
                break;
            case 2:
                System.out.println("Tuesday");
                break;
            case 3:
                System.out.println("Wednesday");
                break;
            case 4:
                System.out.println("Thursday");
                break;
            case 5:
                System.out.println("Friday");
                break;
            case 6:
                System.out.println("Saturday");
                break;
            case 7:
                System.out.println("Sunday");
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Invalid day of the week");
                break;
        }
    }// end of method main
}// end of class WeekDayChecker 
```
## 8. LOOPS

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ieaUdBJJC19uw/giphy-downsized-large.gif">

Java provides several types of loops for different use cases:

| Loop Type | Description | Best use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| for | Iterating through a range of values or an array | Counting loops |
| while | Executing a block of code as long as a certain condition is true | Conditional loops |
| do-while | Executing a block of code at least once before the condition is checked | Loop should always execute at least one time |

Additionally, Java provides two keywords for controlling the flow of loops:

| Keyword | Description |
| --- | --- |
| break | Break out of a loop early |
| continue | Skip an iteration of a loop |

### 8.1 For Loop

A for loop is used for iterating through a range of values or an array. It consists of three parts:

1. initialization
2. termination condition
3. increment/decrement.

### 8.2 For Loop Example

```java
public class ForLoopExample
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        // for loop to print the numbers from 0 to 10
        for (int i = 0; i < 11; i++)
	{
            System.out.println(i);
     	}// end of for loop
    }// end of method main
}// end of class ForLoopExample
```
### 8.3 While Loop
While loop in Java consists of two parts: initialization and termination condition

Initialization : set the initial value for the loop variable before the start of the loop.

Termination condition: the condition that must be met for the loop to continue, if the condition is true the code inside the loop is executed, otherwise the loop is terminated.

It is important to be sure that the termination condition will be false at some point, otherwise the loop will keep running forever, this is called an infinite loop.
### 8.4 While Loop Example
```java
public class WhileLoopExample
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int i = 0; // initialization
        // while loop to iterate through numbers 0 to 10
        while (i < 11) // termination condition
	{ 
            System.out.println(i);
            i++; // increment
        }// end of while loop
    }// end of method main
}// end of class WhileLoopExample
```
### 8.5 Do While Loop
Do-while loop in Java consists of two parts: initialization and termination condition

Initialization : set the initial value for the loop variable before the start of the loop.

Termination condition: the condition that must be met for the loop to continue, if the condition is true the code inside the loop is executed, otherwise the loop is terminated.

The main difference between a while loop and a do-while loop is that the code inside a do-while loop is executed at least once before the termination condition is checked.

It's important to be sure that the termination condition will be false at some point, otherwise the loop will keep running forever, this is called an infinite loop.

### 8.6 Do While Loop Example
```java
public class DoWhileLoopExample
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int counter = 0;
        do 
	{
            System.out.println(counter);
            counter++;
        } while (counter < 10);
    }// end of method main
}// end of class DoWhileLoopExample
```

| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Array | A container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. |
| Creating an Array | Use the keyword "new" followed by the data type of the array and the size of the array in brackets.  |
| Accessing Array Elements | Elements can be accessed using their index, which starts at 0. |
| Modifying Array Elements | Elements can be modified by assigning a new value to a specific index. |
| Array Methods | Java provides various methods in the Arrays class for sorting, searching, and manipulating arrays. |

### 9.1 One Dimensional Array Example
```java
class OneDimensionalArrayExample
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Declare a one-dimensional array of integers
        int[] myArray = new int[5];

        // Assign values to the elements of the array
        myArray[0] = 1;
        myArray[1] = 2;
        myArray[2] = 3;
        myArray[3] = 4;
        myArray[4] = 5;
	// the array
	//  - - - - -
	// |1|2|3|4|5|
	//  - - - - -
        // Print out the third element of the array
        System.out.println("The third element of the array is: " + myArray[2]);
    }// end of method main 
}// end of method OneDimensionalArrayExample
```
### 9.2 Two Dimensional Array 
| Key Point  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Size       | The size of a two-dimensional array is the number of rows multiplied by the number of columns |
| Usage       | Two-dimensional arrays are typically used to store and manipulate data in a tabular format |
| Creation    | They can be created using the `new` keyword and specifying the number of rows and columns |
| Accessing Elements | Elements in a two-dimensional array can be accessed using the `array[row][column]` notation |
| Iteration | They can be iterated using nested loops to access each element individually |
| Pass as a parameter | They can be passed as a parameter to a method just like a one-dimensional array |
| Applications | Two-dimensional arrays are commonly used in many applications such as image processing, game development, and scientific computing.

| Algorithm | Best Case | Worst Case | Average Case | Space Complexity |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|------------------|
| bubble sort|  O(n)     | O(n^2)     |   O(n^2)     |       O(1)       |

### 10.1 Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It repeatedly passes through the list, comparing elements and swapping them as needed, until the list is sorted.

**Time Complexity**:

**Best Case:** O(n) when the list is already sorted, no swapping will be done.

**Worst Case:** O(n^2) when the list is reverse sorted, each element will be compared n times before getting to its correct position.

**Average Case:** O(n^2)

**Space Complexity:** O(1) as it only uses a single additional memory space to keep track of the last swap.

**Stability:** Stable, it preserves the relative order of elements with equal values.

**In-Place:** Yes, it doesn't require extra memory to perform the sort.
```java
class BubbleSort
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
    	// the array before sorting 
        int[] arr = {5, 3, 8, 6, 2, 1, 9, 4, 7};
	// print the array before sorting 
        System.out.println("Original Array: " + Arrays.toString(arr));
	// sort the array
        bubbleSort(arr);
	// print the array after sorting 
        System.out.println("Sorted Array: " + Arrays.toString(arr));
    }// end of method main
    /**
    * sort the array using bubble sort method 
    * @param array - the original array
    * @return None
    */
    public static void bubbleSort(int[] arr)
    {
        int temp;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++)
	{
            for (int j = 1; j < arr.length - i; j++)
	    {
                if (arr[j - 1] > arr[j])
		{
                    temp = arr[j - 1];
                    arr[j - 1] = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = temp;
                }// end of if 
            }// end of nested for loops 
        }// end of for loop
    }// end of method bubbleSort
}// end of class BubbleSort
```
### 10.2 Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds up the final sorted list one item at a time, by inserting each new item into its correct position in the already sorted portion of the list.

**Time Complexity**:

**Best Case:** O(n) when the list is already sorted, each element will be inserted in the first position.

**Worst Case:** O(n^2) when the list is reverse sorted, each element will be compared n times before 
getting to its correct position.

**Average Case:** O(n^2)

**Space Complexity:** O(1) as it only uses a single additional memory space to keep track of the current element and its position.

**Stability:** Stable, it preserves the relative order of elements with equal values.

**In-Place:** Yes, it doesn't require extra memory to perform the sort.

```java
class InsertionSort
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
    	// the array before sorting 
        int[] arr = {5, 3, 8, 6, 2, 1, 9, 4, 7};
	// print the array before sorting 
        System.out.println("Original Array: " + Arrays.toString(arr));
	// sort the array
        insertionSort(arr);
	// print the array after sorting 
        System.out.println("Sorted Array: " + Arrays.toString(arr));
    }// end of method main 
    /**
    * sort the array using insertion sort sort method 
    * @param array - the original array
    * @return None
    */
    public static void insertionSort(int[] arr)
    {
        int key, j;
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++)
	{
            key = arr[i];
            j = i - 1;
            while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key)
	    {
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
                j = j - 1;
            }// end of while loop
            arr[j + 1] = key;
        }// end of foor loop 
    }// end of method insertionSort
}// end of class InsertionSort
```
### 10.3 Selection Sort 

election sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moves it to the sorted portion.

It repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and moves it to the end of the sorted array.

**Time Complexity**:

**Best Case:** O(n^2) when the list is already sorted or reverse sorted.

**Worst Case:** O(n^2) when the list is reverse sorted.

**Average Case:** O(n^2)

**Space Complexity:** O(1) as it only uses a single additional memory space to keep track of the current minimum element and its position.

**Stability:** Unstable, it doesn't preserves the relative order of elements with equal values.

**In-Place:** Yes, it doesn't require extra memory to perform the sort.

```java
public class SelectionSort
{

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int[] arr = {5, 3, 6, 2, 10};
	
        // Print the original array
        System.out.print("Original Array: ");
        for (int i : arr)
	{
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }// end of for loop 

        // Sort the array using selection sort
        selectionSort(arr);

        // Print the sorted array
        System.out.print("\nSorted Array: ");
        for (int i : arr)
	{
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }// end of for loop 
    }// end of method main
    /**
    * sort the array using selection sort method 
    * @param array - the original array
    * @return None
    */
    public static void selectionSort(int[] arr)
    {
        // Loop through the array
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++)
	{
            // Find the index of the minimum element
            int minIndex = i;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++)
	    {
                if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex])
		{
                    minIndex = j;
                }// end of if
            }// end of for loop
            // Swap the minimum element with the current element
            int temp = arr[minIndex];
            arr[minIndex] = arr[i];
            arr[i] = temp;
        }// end of for loop
    }// end of method selectionSort
}// end of class SelectionSort
```

### 10.4 Merge Sort 
Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that repeatedly divides an array or list into two halves until each half contains only one element, and then combines them back together in a sorted order.

The algorithm begins by dividing the array into two equal halves.

It then recursively sorts each half by calling the merge sort function on each half.

Once both halves are sorted, the merge function is called to merge the two sorted halves back together, in a sorted order.

The merge function compares the first element of each half and adds the smaller element to a new array. It then continues this process until one half is exhausted and adds the remaining elements of the other half.

The new array is then returned as the sorted version of the original array.

The merge sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n), making it more efficient than other sorting algorithms such as bubble sort or insertion sort. It is a stable sort, meaning that it preserves the relative order of elements with equal keys. It also requires O(n) extra space to perform the sorting.

```java
public class MergeSort 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        int[] array = {5, 1, 9, 3, 7, 6, 8, 2, 4};
        mergeSort(array);
        for (int i : array) 
	{
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }// end of for 
    }// end of main method 
	
    /**
    * Sorts an array using the merge sort algorithm
    * @param: array - the array to be sorted
    * @return: None
    */
    public static void mergeSort(int[] array) 
    {
        if (array.length > 1) 
	{
	    // Split the array into left and right halves
            int[] left = leftHalf(array);
            int[] right = rightHalf(array);
	    
	    // Recursively sort the left and right halves
            mergeSort(left);
            mergeSort(right);
            // Merge the sorted left and right halves back together
            merge(array, left, right);
        }
    }// end of mergeSort method 
    /**
    * Returns the left half of an array
    * @param array - the original array
    * @return array - the left half of the array
    */
    public static int[] leftHalf(int[] array) 
    {
        int size1 = array.length / 2;
        int[] left = new int[size1];
        for (int i = 0; i < size1; i++)
	{
            left[i] = array[i];
        }
        return left;
    }// end of leftHalf method 
    /**
    * Returns the right half of an array
    * @param array - the original array
    * @return array - the right half of the array
    */
    public static int[] rightHalf(int[] array)
    {
        int size1 = array.length / 2;
        int size2 = array.length - size1;
        int[] right = new int[size2];
        for (int i = 0; i < size2; i++) {
            right[i] = array[i + size1];
        }
        return right;
    }// end of method rightHalf
    /**
    * Merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array
    * @param result - the final sorted array, left - the left half of the array, right - the right half of the array
    @ @return None
    */
    public static void merge(int[] result, int[] left, int[] right)
    {
        int i1 = 0;
        int i2 = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < result.length; i++)
	{
            if (i2 >= right.length || (i1 < left.length && left[i1] <= right[i2]))
	    {
                result[i] = left[i1];
                i1++;
            }
	    else
	    {
                result[i] = right[i2];
                i2++;
            }
        }// end of for loop 
    }// end of merge method 
}// end of class  MergeSort
```
### 10.5 Quick Sort 
Quick Sort is a sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer strategy to sort an array or a list of elements.

The basic idea behind the algorithm is to partition the array into two sub-arrays, one containing elements that are less than a chosen pivot element, and the other containing elements that are greater than the pivot.

The pivot element can be chosen in different ways, but a common approach is to select the last element of the array as the pivot.

Once the array is partitioned, the pivot element is in its final position in the sorted array. The algorithm then recursively sorts the left and right sub-arrays.
```java
public class QuickSort
{

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int[] array = {5, 1, 9, 3, 7, 6, 8, 2, 4};
        sort(array);
        for (int i : array)
	{
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }
    }// end of main method 

    /**
    * Sorts an array using the quick sort algorithm
    * @param array - the array to be sorted
    * @return none
    */
    public static void sort(int[] array)
    {
        sort(array, 0, array.length - 1);
    }// end of sort method 

    /**
    * Sorts an array within a given range using the quick sort algorithm
    * @param array - the array to be sorted, int - low - the lower bound of the range to be sorted int - high - the upper bound of the range to be sorted
    * @return None
    */
    private static void sort(int[] array, int low, int high)
    {
        if (low < high)
	{
            // Choose pivot and partition the array
            int pivotIndex = partition(array, low, high);
            // Recursively sort the left and right partitions
            sort(array, low, pivotIndex);
            sort(array, pivotIndex + 1, high);
        }
    }// end of sort method 

    /**
    * Partitions an array within a given range and returns the pivot index
    * @param array - the array to be partitioned, int - low - the lower bound of the range to be partitioned, int high - the upper bound of the range to be partitioned
    * @return the pivot index
    */
    private static int partition(int[] array, int low, int high)
    {
        int pivot = array[high];
        int i = low - 1;
        for (int j = low; j < high; j++)
	{
            if (array[j] <= pivot)
	    {
                i++;
                // Swap array[i] and array[j]
                int temp = array[i];
                array[i] = array[j];
                array[j] = temp;
            }
        }
        // Swap array[i + 1] and array[high]
        int temp = array[i + 1];
        array[i + 1] = array[high];
        array[high] = temp;
        return i + 1;
    }// end of partition method 
}// end of QuickSort class 
```
### 10.6 Heap Sort 
Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that is based on the binary heap data structure.

In Java, it can be implemented by first creating a max heap out of the input array, and then repeatedly extracting the maximum element from the heap and placing it at the end of the sorted array. 

The process continues until the heap is empty, resulting in a sorted array in ascending order. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) and requires O(1) extra space.
```java
class HeapSort
{

    // Heap sort method
    public static void heapSort(int[] arr)
    {
        int n = arr.length;

        // Build heap (rearrange array)
        for (int i = n / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--)
	{
	   heapify(arr, n, i);
	}
        // One by one extract an element from heap
        for (int i=n-1; i>=0; i--)
	{
            // Move current root to end
            int temp = arr[0];
            arr[0] = arr[i];
            arr[i] = temp;

            // call max heapify on the reduced heap
            heapify(arr, i, 0);
        }
    }// end of method heapSort

    // To heapify a subtree rooted with node i which is
    // an index in arr[]. n is size of heap
    static void heapify(int[] arr, int n, int i) 
    {
        int largest = i;  // Initialize largest as root
        int l = 2*i + 1;  // left = 2*i + 1
        int r = 2*i + 2;  // right = 2*i + 2

        // If left child is larger than root
        if (l < n && arr[l] > arr[largest])
	{
	   largest = l;
	}
            
        // If right child is larger than largest so far
        if (r < n && arr[r] > arr[largest])
	{
	     largest = r;
	}
	
        // If largest is not root
        if (largest != i)
	{
            int swap = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[largest];
            arr[largest] = swap;

            // Recursively heapify the affected sub-tree
            heapify(arr, n, largest);
        }
    }// end of heapify method 

    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int[] arr = {12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7};
        heapSort(arr);

        System.out.println("Sorted array is:");
        for (int i=0; i<arr.length; ++i)
	{
	    System.out.print(arr[i]+" ");
	}      
    }// end of main method 
}// end of class HeapSort
```
## 11. SEARCHING ALGORITHMS

Searching algorithms are a set of methods used to locate specific data within a larger data set. 

The most common types of searching algorithms include linear search, binary search, jump search, interpolation search, depth-first search, and breadth-first search.

| Algorithm        | Time Complexity           | Space Complexity |
| ------------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| Linear Search     | O(n)                      | O(1)             |
| Binary Search     | O(log n)                  | O(1)             |
| Jump Search       | O(‚àön)                     | O(1)             |
| Interpolation Search | O(log log n)             | O(1)             |
| Depth First Search| O(V + E)                   | O(V)             |
| Breadth First Search| O(V + E)                  | O(V)    

### 11.1 Linear Search
inear search is the simplest search algorithm and involves iterating through each element of the data set until the desired element is found.

The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the data set.

```java
public class LinearSearch
{
    /**
    * Method to implement Linear Search algorithm to find a specific element in an array. 
    * If the element doesn't exist in the array, the method returns -1.
    * @param array - array, int x - the number we want to find  
    * @return int 
    */
    public static int linearSearch(int[] arr, int x)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
	{
            if (arr[i] == x)
	    {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }// end of linearSearch method 

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int[] arr = {2, 3, 4, 10, 40};
        int x = 10;

        int result = linearSearch(arr, x);
        if (result == -1)
	{
            System.out.println("Element not present in array.");
        } 
	else
	{
            System.out.println("Element found at index: " + result);
        }
    }// end of main method 
}// end of class LinearSearch
```

### 11.1 Binary Search 
Binary search is a more efficient search algorithm that works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

The time complexity for this algorithm is O(log n), which makes it more efficient than linear search for large data sets.
```java
public class BinarySearch
{
    /**
    * Method to implement Binary Search algorithm to find a specific element in an array. 
    * If the element doesn't exist in the array, the method returns -1.
    * @param array, int x
    * @return int 
    */
    public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int x)
    {
        int left = 0;
        int right = arr.length - 1;
        while (left <= right)
	{
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] == x)
	    {
                return mid;
            } 
	    else if (arr[mid] < x)
	    {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
	    else
	    {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }// end of method binarySearch

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int[] arr = {2, 3, 4, 10, 40};
        int x = 10;

        int result = binarySearch(arr, x);
        if (result == -1)
	{
            System.out.println("Element not present in array.");
        }
	else
	{
            System.out.println("Element found at index: " + result);
        }
    }// end of main method 
}// end of class BinarySearch
```

### 11.2 Jump Search
Jump search is an algorithm that works by jumping a fixed number of elements at a time instead of iterating through each element. The time complexity for this algorithm is O(‚àön).

```java
public class JumpSearch
{
    /**
    * Method to implement Jump Search algorithm to find a specific element in an array. 
    * If the element doesn't exist in the array, the method returns -1.
    * @param array - the array to search through, int x - the element to search for
    * @return int - the index of the element if found, -1 if not found
    */
    public static int jumpSearch(int[] array, int x)
    {
        int n = array.length;
        int step = (int) Math.sqrt(n);
        int prev = 0;
        while (array[Math.min(step, n) - 1] < x)
	{
            prev = step;
            step += (int) Math.sqrt(n);
            if (prev >= n)
	    {
                return -1;
            }
        }
        while (array[prev] < x)
	{
            prev++;
            if (prev == Math.min(step, n))
	    {
                return -1;
            }
        }
        if (array[prev] == x)
	{
            return prev;
        }
        return -1;
    }// end of method jumpSearch

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int[] array = {0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144};
        int x = 55;
        int index = jumpSearch(array, x);
        if (index != -1)
	{
            System.out.println("Element found at index: " + index);
        }
	else
	{
            System.out.println("Element not found in array.");
        }
    }// end of main method 
}// end of class JumpSearch
```
### 11.3 Interpolation Search
Interpolation search is a search algorithm for sorted arrays. 

It works by making an educated guess about the position of the element in the array, based on the value of the element and the range of values in the array. 

The algorithm then repeatedly narrows down the search space by determining if the guessed position is too high or too low, and then updating the guess based on this information.

The algorithm terminates when the element is found or when the search space has been narrowed down to a single element that is not the target.

Interpolation search is faster than a typical binary search when the elements in the array are uniformly distributed.

```java
public class InterpolationSearch
{
    /**
    * Method to implement Interpolation Search algorithm to find a specific element in an array. 
    * If the element doesn't exist in the array, the method returns -1.
    * @param array - the array to search through, int x - the element to search for
    * @return int - the index of the element if found, -1 if not found
    */
    public static int interpolationSearch(int[] array, int x)
    {
        int low = 0;
        int high = array.length - 1;
        while (low <= high && x >= array[low] && x <= array[high])
	{
            int pos = low + (((high - low) / (array[high] - array[low])) * (x - array[low]));
            if (array[pos] == x)
	    {
                return pos;
            }
            if (array[pos] < x)
	    {
                low = pos + 1;
            } 
	    else
	    {
                high = pos - 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }// end of method interpolationSearch

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int[] array = {10, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 33, 35, 42, 47};
        int x = 18;
        int index = interpolationSearch(array, x);
        if (index != -1)
	{
            System.out.println("Element found at index: " + index);
        } 
	else
	{
            System.out.println("Element not found in array.");
        }
    }// end of main method 
}// end of InterpolationSearch class 
```
### 11.4 Depth First Search
Depth First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

It starts at a specific vertex (or source node) and visits each vertex in the graph by following each edge as far as possible before backtracking.

DFS can be implemented using a stack data structure, where the vertices that have yet to be visited are pushed onto the stack, and the last vertex added to the stack is the next vertex to be visited.

The algorithm terminates when all vertices have been visited or when a specific goal vertex is found. DFS can be used to find the connected components of a graph, solve puzzles and games, and find the paths between two vertices in a graph.

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class DepthFirstSearch
{
    static class TreeNode
    {
        int val;
        TreeNode left;
        TreeNode right;

        TreeNode(int val)
	{
            this.val = val;
            this.left = null;
            this.right = null;
        }
    }// end of class TreeNode

    /**
     * Method to implement Depth First Search algorithm to find a specific element in a tree.
     * If the element doesn't exist in the tree, the method returns false.
     * @param root - the root of the tree, int x - the element to search for
     * @return boolean - true if the element is found, false if not found
     */
      public static boolean dfs(TreeNode root, int x)
      {
        if (root == null)
	{
            return false;
        }
        if (root.val == x)
	{
            return true;
        }
        boolean left = dfs(root.left, x);
        boolean right = dfs(root.right, x);
        return left || right;
      }// end of method dfs

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(1);
        root.left = new TreeNode(2);
        root.right = new TreeNode(3);
        root.left.left = new TreeNode(4);
        root.left.right = new TreeNode(5);
        int x = 4;
        boolean found = dfs(root, x);
        if (found)
	{
            System.out.println("Element found in tree.");
        }
	else
	{
            System.out.println("Element not found in tree.");
        }
    }// end of method main
}// end of class DepthFirstSearch
```
### 11.5 Breadth First Search
Breadth First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, meaning it visits all the vertices at a given depth level before moving on to the next level. 

It starts at a specific vertex (or source node) and visits all its neighboring vertices first, before visiting the vertices at the next level.

BFS can be implemented using a queue data structure, where the vertices to be visited are added to the queue, and the first vertex in the queue is the next vertex to be visited.

The algorithm terminates when all vertices have been visited or when a specific goal vertex is found. BFS can be used to find the shortest path between two vertices in a graph, find the connected components of a graph and solve puzzles and games.

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class BreadthFirstSearch
{
    /**
    * method find a specific element in a tree using breadth first search
    * if the element is not found, the method returns -1
    * @param Node root - the root of the tree, int x - the element to search for
    * @return int - the value of the element if found, -1 if not found
    */
    public static int bfs(Node root, int x)
    {
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(root);

        while (!queue.isEmpty())
	{
            Node current = queue.poll();
            if (current.value == x)
	    {
                return current.value;
            }
            if (current.left != null)
	    {
                queue.add(current.left);
            }
            if (current.right != null)
	    {
                queue.add(current.right);
            }
        }

        return -1;
      }// end of method bfs

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // create a sample tree for demonstration
        Node root = new Node(1);
        root.left = new Node(2);
        root.right = new Node(3);
        root.left.left = new Node(4);
        root.left.right = new Node(5);

        int elementToFind = 4;
        int result = bfs(root, elementToFind);
        System.out.println("Value of element " + elementToFind + ": " + result);
    }// end of main method 
}// end of class BreadthFirstSearch

class Node
{
    int value;
    Node left;
    Node right;

    public Node(int value)
    {
        this.value = value;
        left = null;
        right = null;
    }// end of method Node 
}// end of class Node
```

## 13. STRING CLASS

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/xT5LMLKAxV7XswLQsw/giphy.gif">

The String class in Java is a built-in class that represents a sequence of characters. It is one of the most widely used classes in Java, and it is used to represent text. Some of the key features of the String class include:

Immutable: Once a String object is created, its value cannot be changed. Any operation that modifies the value of a String will create a new String object.

Concatenation: The + operator can be used to concatenate two String objects. The concat() method can also be used to concatenate String objects.

Comparison: The equals() method can be used to compare the values of two String objects. The compareTo() method can be used to compare the lexicographic order of two String objects.

Searching: The indexOf() method can be used to find the index of a specific character or substring within a String. The lastIndexOf() method can be used to find the last occurrence of a specific character or substring within a String.

Substring: The substring() method can be used to extract a portion of a String.

Manipulation: The toLowerCase(), toUpperCase(), trim() method can be used to manipulate the string.

Split: The split() method can be used to split a String into an array of substrings based on a specified delimiter.

Formatting: The format() method can be used to format String in a specific way.

Regular expression: String class has matches() method that can be used to check if the string matches a specific regular expression.

These are some of the most common and useful methods of the String class. It also has many other methods that provide additional functionality.

## 14. STRING BUFFER CLASS

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/uurtMtTKqkJda4dk8Y/giphy-downsized.gif">

StringBuffer is a class in Java that provides a mutable sequence of characters.

It is similar to the String class, but it can be modified after it is created. StringBuffer is thread-safe, meaning that multiple threads can access a single StringBuffer object without causing any problems.

Some common methods of the StringBuffer class include append, insert, and reverse. Additionally, StringBuffer has a capacity that can be increased if necessary to prevent reallocation of memory while concatenation.

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `append(Object obj)` | Appends the string representation of the Object argument. |
| `charAt(int index)` | Returns the char value in this sequence at the specified index. |
| `delete(int start,int end)` | Removes the characters in a substring of this sequence. |
| `deleteCharAt(int index)` | Removes the char at the specified position in this sequence. |
| `getChars(int srcBegin,int srcEnd,char[] dst,int dstBegin)` | Characters are copied from this sequence into the destination character array dst. |
| `equals(StringBuffer sb)` | Compares this object against the specified object. |
| `indexOf(String str)` | Returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of the specified substring. |
| `indexOf(String str,int fromIndex)` | Returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of the specified substring, starting at the specified index. |
| `insert(int offset,String str)` | Inserts the string into this character sequence. |
| `lastIndexOf(String str,int fromIndex)` | Returns the index within this string of the last occurrence of the specified substring. |
| `length()` | Returns the length (character count). |
| `replace(int start,int end,String str)` | Replaces the characters in a substring of this sequence with characters in the specified String. |

## 15. METHODS

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/lS0uY9t6lCi69FcWRA/giphy-downsized.gif">

In Java, methods are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are used to encapsulate functionality and can be called multiple times within a program.

A method that has a return type of void, which means it does not return any value.

A method that has a return type and a method name, which means it returns a value of the specified type.

A method can be marked as static, which means it can be called without creating an instance of the class.

A method can take in parameters of different types and names, for example methodName(parameterType parameterName, parameterType parameterName)
A method can be marked as final, which means it cannot be overridden by subclasses.
A method can be marked as abstract, which means it has no implementation and must be implemented by subclasses.

It's worth noting that the return type can be any valid Java data type, including primitives, objects, and arrays. Also, the naming convention of methods are camelCase and the first letter is lowercase.

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `void returnType()` |  A method that has a return type of void, which means it does not return any value. |
| `returnType methodName()` | A method that has a return type and a method name, which means it returns a value of the specified type. |
| `static returnType methodName()` | A method that is marked as static, which means it can be called without creating an instance of the class. |
| `methodName(parameterType parameterName)` | A method that takes in a parameter of the specified type and name. |
| `methodName(parameterType parameterName, parameterType parameterName)` | A method that takes in multiple parameters of different types and names. |
| `final returnType methodName()` | A method that is marked as final, which means it cannot be overridden by subclasses. |
| `abstract returnType methodName()` | A method that is marked as abstract, which means it has no implementation and must be implemented by subclasses. |

## 16. RANDOM NUMBERS

In Java, there are several ways to generate random numbers.

The most commonly used method is through the use of the "Random" class, which is part of the Java standard library.

This class provides methods for generating various types of random numbers, such as integers, doubles, and booleans. Additionally, the class also provides methods for generating random numbers within a specified range.

```java
import java.util.Random;

public class RandomNumbers
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Creating an object of the Random class
        Random rand = new Random();
        
        // Generating a random integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive)
        int randomInt = rand.nextInt(10);
        System.out.println("Random Integer: " + randomInt);

        // Generating a random float between 0 and 1 (inclusive)
        float randomFloat = rand.nextFloat();
        System.out.println("Random Float: " + randomFloat);

        // Generating a random double between 0 and 1 (inclusive)
        double randomDouble = rand.nextDouble();
        System.out.println("Random Double: " + randomDouble);
    }// end of method main 
}// end of class RandomNumbers 
```

## 17. RECURSION

![CatsGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/213818272-6a195ca3-2252-4b7f-8255-02ba2a514ee4.gif)

Recursion in Java is a programming technique where a method calls itself in order to solve a problem. The method has a base case, which is a simple and straightforward problem that can be solved without recursion, and a recursive case, which breaks down the problem into simpler subproblems that can be solved using the same method.

In order for a recursive method to terminate, it must have a base case that is reached at some point. If the base case is not reached, the method will continue calling itself indefinitely, resulting in a stack overflow error.

A common example of recursion is the factorial function, which calculates the factorial of a given number. This can be computed using a loop, but it can also be computed using recursion.

Recursive methods can also be more efficient than their iterative counterparts, as they can take advantage of the computer's stack memory to store temporary data.

However, recursion can also consume more memory and processing power, so it's important to use it judiciously and be mindful of the problem's complexities.

It's also important to be mindful of the problem's complexities when using recursion and that some problems can be solved more efficiently with an iterative approach.

```java
public class Recursion 
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Call the recursive method
        int result = factorial(5);
        System.out.println("Factorial of 5: " + result);
    }// end of method main 

    // Recursive method to calculate the factorial of a given number
    public static int factorial(int n)
    {
        // Base case: if n is 0 or 1, return 1
        if (n == 0 || n == 1)
	{
            return 1;
        }
        // Recursive case: return n * factorial(n-1)
        else 
	{
            return n * factorial(n-1);
        }
    }// end of method factorial
}// end of class Recursion 
```
## 17. READ AND WRITE TO FILE

![INeedThoseFilesAssistantSpecialAgentInChargeJubalValentineGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/213818305-5e1e57df-ac01-446c-85ca-511c5c7d7b1a.gif)

Reading and writing to a file in Java can be done using the File and Scanner classes for reading, and the FileWriter and PrintWriter classes for writing.

To read a file, you can first create a File object that represents the file you want to read, and then create a Scanner object that reads the contents of the file. You can then use the nextLine() method of the Scanner class to read each line of the file.

To write a file, you can first create a FileWriter object that represents the file you want to write to, and then create a PrintWriter object that writes to the file. You can then use the println() method of the PrintWriter class to write to the file.

It's important to handle the exception when reading and writing to a file in case the file doesn't exist or there's a problem with the file path.

When reading and writing to a file, it's also important to close the file when you're finished. This can be done by calling the close() method on the Scanner, FileWriter, and PrintWriter objects.

It's also worth noting that java.nio package offers another set of classes to perform file reading and writing operations such as Files, Paths and BufferedReader which offer better performance and flexibility over the traditional IO package.

```java
import java.io.*;

public class WorkWithFile
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // File to read from
        File file = new File("example.txt");
        // File to write to
        File outputFile = new File("output.txt");
        
        try 
	{
            // Reading from file
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) 
	    {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
            br.close();
            
            // Writing to file
            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(outputFile));
            writer.println("Writing to file example");
            writer.close();
            
        } 
	catch (IOException e
	{
            System.out.println("An error occurred.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }// end of main method 
}// end of class WorkWithFile
```

## 19. LINKED LIST
A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, each containing a reference (or "link") to its next element. In Java, the LinkedList class is a commonly used implementation of a linked list.

One of the main advantages of a linked list over an array is that elements can be easily inserted or removed from the middle of the list. With an array, these operations would require shifting all of the elements after the insertion or removal point.

The LinkedList class in Java provides a variety of methods for working with the list, such as adding and removing elements, retrieving elements at specific positions, and searching for elements. It also implements the List interface, which means it has all the common methods that a list should have like add(), get(), remove(), size(), clear(), etc.

The LinkedList class uses a doubly-linked list implementation, which means that each element has a reference to both the next and the previous element in the list. This allows for efficient traversal in both directions.

It's worth noting that LinkedList is less efficient than an ArrayList when it comes to random access of elements (i.e. by index) since it needs to traverse the list from the head to the element's index.

It's also worth noting that linked lists require more memory than arrays, as each element requires a reference to the next element in addition to the element's value.

```java
import java.io.*; 
    
// Java program to implement 
// a Singly Linked List
